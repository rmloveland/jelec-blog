Have you ever wanted to transform into a bird and fly away?

Have you ever wanted to speak to the animals in their own languages?

Do you enjoy stories that feature poems and verse, magic spells and
the secret names of things?

Do you enjoy the occasional puzzle?

If so, join 12-year-old Glynis McGinty and the raven Meldrake in the
Realm of the White Bear as they solve puzzles and mysteries, meet
other talking creatures of land and air, and have various
magic-infused adventures!

All of this adventuring is done with the
goal of saving a group of lost children who've fallen in with the
"wrong" magical crowd in this series of fantasy novellas from
R.M. Loveland, the author of [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006U337YW][*Jelec, the White Bear*, or: /Beware an
Encounter with a Raven and his Friends/]].
