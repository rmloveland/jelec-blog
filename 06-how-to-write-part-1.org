#+TITLE: How to Write, Part I: Who not to Listen to

[[./img/06-embroidered-flower.jpg]]

This is the first in a planned series of articles in which I will teach you
how to write. More precisely: I will teach you how to /learn/ how to
write. The rest involves a great deal of hard work that you'll have to
do for yourself.

Perhaps you're wondering what qualifies me to make such a claim? It's
only fair that I should share my background. I have a Bachelor's
degree in English, with a concentration in Creative Writing. While
studying for that degree, I studied closely under two professors who
were themselves published authors. During my time at a previous
college, I was lucky enough to study under two equally talented,
published writers. Please bear in mind that when I say published, I
don't mean published in an academic journal.

Does this mean I'm a good writer? Am I claiming that the skill and
success of others is somehow reflective of my own? No. But it means I've been around
writers better than me. And that's important. If you want to learn how
to write, you should /study those who are better than you, and
politely disregard everyone else/.

This does not mean that you should be rude or dismissive. Please note
the use of the word 'politely.' I'm simply claiming that you will not
improve by listening to advice from any of the following groups:

- /Non-Writing Friends and Family/

  They may know you personally, but it doesn't mean they know anything
  about writing, or your writing in particular. /Sole Exception/: if you are
  lucky enough to have friends or family members whose intelligence,
  experience, and taste you respect, by all means solicit feedback
  from them on your work. Don't expect them to come back singing its
  praises, though. You will probably be disappointed. 

- /People who Don't Read Much/

  It's sad but true that many people simply don't read very much. How
  could they possibly have any useful opinions about your writing if
  they don't read? (Note that I am explicitly /not/ talking about
  audiobook listeners here. I have a number of friends who enjoy
  listening to audiobooks. They qualify as readers. Ask Random House.)

- /People who Identify as "Writers" but who do not Actually Write Anything/

  Nothing new here: /Writers write/. Non-writers who sit around and
  talk about writing are an annoyance at best. At worst, they'll pull
  you down with them. Avoid them.

- /Bad Writers/

  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect][Dunning-Kruger]] tells us that there are lots of bad writers out
  there, and that I'm probably one of them. That's OK, nobody's
  perfect. But be aware of this, and be especially aware of it if
  you're not sure where /you/ stand. Dunning-Kruger in a nutshell: if
  you think you're pretty good, chances are you're not. If you think
  you're pretty bad, you might in fact be pretty bad. Then again, you
  might be a little better than average (Most people who are above
  average rate their skills too low -- see the link above).

That covers the basics about who /not/ to learn from. I'll have more to
say about some positive actions you can take to improve your writing
in my next installment.
