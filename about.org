I'm the author of the fantasy novel /Jelec, the White Bear, or, Beware
an Encounter with a Raven and his Friends/, which is available on
Amazon [[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006U337YW][here]].

I live in Upstate New York with my lovely wife. Many of the locations
in the book are inspired by places in New York State. If you're not
from New York, never fear, it's not about any place accessible from
this version of reality!

You can read the complete first chapter for free [[http://jelec.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/jelec-the-complete-first-chapter][online]] (or download
a [[http://jelec.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/jelec-preview2.pdf][PDF]], if you like).

I've written a little bit more about this blog and the topics I intend
to cover in the [[http://jelec.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/a-trail-of-breadcrumbs-starts-here/][first post]].
