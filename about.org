* The Story So Far...

I'm the author of the fantasy novel /Jelec, the White Bear, or, Beware an Encounter with a Raven and his Friends/, which is soon to be available on Amazon's Kindle Bookstore.

It's the story of a young girl named Glynis McGinty, who works in the laundry room at an ancient Victorian-era hotel near her home in the mountains. One day, she discovers a stained glass door in the basement storage, one decorated with a strange motif, and which holds an even stranger appeal: on the other side of that door are adventures with Meldrake the Raven and various (soon-to-be) friends, enemies, and others who fall somewhere in between. They are all inhabitants of a world rather like our own, equal parts magical and measurable, where bears and ravens speak in their own secret tongues and live in towns and cities of their own making.

Over them all falls the long shadow of Jelec, the White Bear, who is also called the Protector, though no one still living can remember why he should have such a name. In fact, he has not been sighted in the realm which some call his in many years, and another power rises, one that aspires to hold the realm for its own.

I've written a little bit more about this blog and the topics I intend to cover in the [[http://jelec.wordpress.com/2011/12/22/a-trail-of-breadcrumbs-starts-here/][first post]].
