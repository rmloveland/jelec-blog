#+TITLE: Linkdump: Ebook and Self-Publishing Resources

[[./img/04-library.jpg]]

I've spent a great deal of time over the last weeks compiling
information on various facets of ebook creation, distribution,
etc. I'll be digging into many of these topics at length in upcoming
posts, but for today I'd like to give you a nice, juicy linkdump from
my own notes for your reading pleasure.

* LeanPub

  http://leanpub.com/

  'Leanpub' is a Canadian company that pays you a 90% royalty rate, minus
  a $0.50 fee per book sold. You set your own price, and retain all
  rights to the books, including the right to publish elsewhere (Amazon,
  etc.) or sell to traditional publishers at some point. Their name is
  a reference to the idea that you can publish works-in-progress and
  get feedback along the way. In addition, you can publish
  compilations of blogs. I've read a few books that were compilations
  derived from blogs I like. It's a great format. I'm getting
  pretty excited about these guys.

* Kindle Direct

  https://kdp.amazon.com/self-publishing/signin

  Amazon offers 'Kindle Direct Publishing', whereby you sell your ebook
  directly to Amazon's customers via their web store. There are two
  royalty options: 35% and 70% (see [[http://jelec.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/amazon-royalty-options-which-one-is-best-for-you/][here]] for an analysis of their
  royalty rates).

* Smashwords

  http://www.smashwords.com/

  Smashwords is a distributor, and kind of a one-stop shop for taking
  your book from humble Word document to an ebook for sale with Apple, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, and
  more. Be aware that they take an additional royalty on top of the
  royalties each of those stores takes (as I understand it). However, they make ebook
  publishing dead simple, and do a lot of the book-creation and
  distribution legwork for you. Marketing is still your problem, though.

* Barnes & Noble PubIt!

  http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/pubit_app/bn?t=pi_reg_home

  Barnes & Noble's direct sales channel for the Nook. It looks like it's
  available via their website as well. 

* J.A. Konrath's Blog

  http://jakonrath.blogspot.com/

  J.A. Konrath writes a lot about ebook and self-publishing at his
  blog. He's gone from $40,000 salary midlister to being, in his words,
  "in the top tax bracket." So it's only one data point, but you can
  learn a lot about the game from reading his blog. 

* Calibre Ebook Software

  http://calibre-ebook.com

  Calibre is a free ebook reader. It also does conversions among various
  ebook formats. For those of you who are programmer-types, you can
  bypass the GUI and script =calibre= using the command-line interface.

* Writer Beware

  http://www.sfwa.org/for-authors/writer-beware/

  Finally, the SF & F writers of America (SFWA), which is sort of a trade
  organization for traditionally published writers, has a page up that
  has lots of useful links about scams and so forth, basically a
  signpost for what to avoid. They're biased in favor of traditional
  over self-publishing, but that is where their membership comes from,
  after all. Still plenty of interesting and useful information there,
  though.
