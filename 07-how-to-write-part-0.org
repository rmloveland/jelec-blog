#+TITLE: How to Write, Part 0: Reading is Essence

[[./img/07-books.jpg]]

For the [[https://jelec.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/how-to-write-part-i-who-not-to-listen-to/][first]] post in this series, go [[https://jelec.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/how-to-write-part-i-who-not-to-listen-to/][here]].

Why am I calling this Part 0, when I've already written Part I?
Because in some ways, I needed to backtrack from the act of writing to
that which comes first -- namely, reading.

Like many writers, I spent a wonderful childhood surrounded by the
imaginary creatures, people, and places found in books. Whatever was
going on in the outside world was somehow less important than what went on in
the latest book or story I found myself living inside.

I've long suspected that this is a common phenomenon.

My argument, therefore, is this: in order to write well, you must read
a great deal. One of the best ways to learn remains /monkey see,
monkey do/. No amount of workshopping, collaboration, or talking about
your writing process will help you improve so much as burying your
head in books for ten years. (Good books!)

This does not mean workshops and
collaboration are unimportant. It means that if you have not read a
great deal, and do not possess the requisite familiarity with
language, phrasing, grammar, and the like, you are walking into a
workshop without the tools you need to do your best work. This does
not mean you are lazy, or somehow unworthy, somehow "not good enough,"
but that you are simply unprepared. One can go from being unprepared
to a state of readiness. It's just a matter of time, and work. Anyone
can do it, if his or her desire is great enough. Talent is almost
always overcome by preparation and hard work, in the end.

So many activities that surround writing and the writer's life are
distractions. There is a mantra I've developed that serves as a
reminder: /essence over ephemera/. Reading is essence.
